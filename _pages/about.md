I am a Ph.D. candidate and research assistant from Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at University of California, Davis. I am advised by Professor [Zhaodan Kong](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/kong/) from the [Cyber-Human-Physical Systems](https://www.cphslab.com/) lab.


I graduated with a Bachelar degree in Energy and Power Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and obtained my Master degree in Mechanical Engineering from Arizona State University. I am currently working towards my Ph.D. degree at UC Davis. 

If you need a Resume/CV of me, please email me at <pengweiww@gmail.com>

### Research Focus
___

My goal is to develop high-performance control algorithms for unmanned aerial systems flying in challenging environments (e.g, near ground, high wind, GPS-denied). Towards this end, I have focused on unmanned aerial vehicle system modeling, opitmal control, deep learning and vision-based navigation. I also have rich hands-on experience with embedded systems and simulation environments development.
