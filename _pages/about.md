I am currently a *Postdoctoral Scholar* from the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at University of California, Davis. I am working with  Professor [Stavros G. Vougioukas](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/) in his Bio-Automation lab. I recieved my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC Davis in 2023. 

### Research Expertise ###
___
My research journey is deeply rooted in the intricate world of robots and automated systems. During my Ph.D., I dedicated years to developing and optimizing unmanned aerial systems, aiming for enhanced autonomy and efficiency. As a postdoctoral scholar at the Bio-Automation lab, my focus has expanded to develop optimal planning and scheduling algorithms for agricultural robots. The results of this work will promise enhanced operational efficiency, reduced energy consumption, increased safety, and a notable reduction in the necessity for manual labor.
