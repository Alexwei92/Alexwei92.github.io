I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering from University of California, Davis. I am working with  Professor [Stavros Vougioukas](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/) in his Bio-Automation lab. I recieved my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC Davis in 2023. 

### Research Expertise
___
My research journey is deeply rooted in the intricate world of robots and automated systems. During my Ph.D., I dedicated years to the development and optimization of unmmaned aerial systems, aiming for enhanced autonomoy and efficiency. As a postdoctoral scholar at the Bio-Automation lab, my foccus has expanded to develop optimal planning algorithms, particularly targeted at enhancing the scheduling, field coverage, and enery aware motion strategy for agricultural robots. The results of these work will promise enhanced operational efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and a notable reduction in the necessity for manuarl labor.
